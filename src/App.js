  //HTML comment has the HTML breakdown
  //now that I am done with deciding the html tags, I need to break it down into react components
  //react components have been saved as the same named text group
  //now I will write the stuff as the components that I have decided
  //ok so first of all I made empty file for all components and then imported them into App.js
  //then I looked at the plan and wrote the most basic html in each component, components like card that needed to be dynamic, well I left those components empty so that I may work on them later, for now the html is like 90% done
  //EDIT: for now I am adding nothing dyanimc, I am going to assume that number of card and reviews is constant, afterall I need to finish this project today itself ðŸ˜¬
  //now I will add the meta and open graph tags in index.html
  //go to specials.js to learn how to import images into components
