//I wanted to pass image into the card component since I can not hardcode it, first I tried passing the path "../assets/img" as a prop and then using require in the component (i used require since I did not know how importing individually in component would work) but turns out that require can not take dynamic values, it needs string literals
//so the way to do it is to import all the images in the parent component and pass them on like props like I have done
